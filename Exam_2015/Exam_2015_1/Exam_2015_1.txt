Part 1

1. a) <article class="important">...</article>
2. d) Cross-Site Scripting
3. c) Rainbow Tables
4. a) Files on the server
5. 10 
(NOTE: No error is found. The $foo variable used in the function is 
a local variable to the function, so it doesn't relate to the foo in the
script. If it was declared in the function that foo was global, than the 
output would have been 15).
6. If not used with a ready event handler,
the code can be executed before the pages loads.
Therefore, some elements used by the code
may not exists yet.
7. HTTP is a stateless protocol because the session state is kept 
entirely on the client. All the necessary information to understand 
the request is send by the client. Each request is executed independently
without any knowledge of the requests that were executed before it. So no
state is stored on the server.
8. a) Generate XML files


Part 2

1. R(a, b, c, d)
a: inline
b: ids
c: class, content-class(:), attributes
d: element, content-element(::)

a) 
R1(0, 0, 0, 2)
R2(0, 0, 0, 2)
R3(0, 0, 2, 1)
R4(0, 0, 0, 2)
R5(0, 1, 0, 1)
R6(0, 0, 1, 0)

b) R1 to R3
Title: Browser Default
1st Par: Red(R1) -- Blue(R2) -- Green(R3)
2nd Par: Red(R1) -- Blue(R2)
Footer: Red(R1) -- Green(R3)

c) All Rules
Title: Cyan
1st Par: Red(R1) -- Blue(R2)
2nd Par: Red(R1) -- Blue(R2) -- yellow(R4)
Footer: Red(R1) -- Green(R3)

NOTE: R3 doesn't apply to 1st Par because :first-child means 
its the first element regardless of type. The <p> before just declares
that the first element must be of type <p>. So R3 doesn't mean first-element
of type <p>. It means the select the first element and that element must
be of type <p>.
