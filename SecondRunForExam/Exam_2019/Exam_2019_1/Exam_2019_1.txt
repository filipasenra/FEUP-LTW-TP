1. Mandatory in a valid HTML Document
- HTML Tag (preferably with lang - ex: en-US)
- Head Tag with Title Tag
- Body Tag

a)

2. b)
In alternately, <label for="id_of_input">Username: </label>
<input id="id_of_input" type="text"></label>

3. a)

4. c) 

5. d) 

The float property removes an element from the document flow and shifts 
it to the left or to the right until it touches the edge of its 
containing box or another floated element.

A expands all the horizontal space!

6. b)

rem-> relative to the root (root usually 16px)
em -> relative to the parent
Because it is applied to all the divs, when it reaches DEF the font-size is
2*2*size_of_root_font = 16*4px.

7. c) Doesn't convert types!

8. c) 
If we want it to stop the execution, we have to follow the header expression 
with die or exit.

9. b)

10. a)

11. b) 

The token is generated and stored on the server (in SESSION)
Then is put (hidden) in a form request
Finally, the server conforms if the token on the server equals the token 
received from the browser.

12. b)

Remember, rainbow tables store hash's of the most common passwords.
If we use a different salt for each password, than the hash in a rainbow 
table for a password doesn't match with our hash.

Brute force attacks try several word passwords; they don't rely on hashes. 

//================
R(a, b, c, d)
a: inline
b: id //#
c: class, attribute, pseudo-class(:) //.
d: element, pseudo-element(::)

13. R1(0, 0, 1, 1)
14. R2(0, 0, 2, 1)
15. R3(0, 1, 0, 1)
16. R4(0, 0, 1, 1)
17. R5(0, 0, 3, 2)
18. R6(0, 1, 2, 2)

19. Color of second element in the list - B - after all rules are applied

Green (R1) -- Yellow (R2) -- Inherit -- Purple (R5)

NOTE: R6 doesn't because there isn't any element li that is a (direct) child of #foo
NOTE2: Color of R4 applies rather than R3 because R3 selects the section 
and R4 selects the ul. So Inherit goes to it's parent first that is the ul.

20. A groundho[g would hog all the ground he could hog, if a groundhog could hog g]round
21. A [groundhog would hog] all the ground he could hog, if a groundhog could hog ground
22. A groundhog would hog a[ll] the ground he could hog, if a groundhog could hog ground
23. A groundhog would hog all the [ground] he could hog, if a groundhog could hog ground
24. A groundhog would hog all the ground he could hog, if a groundhog could hog [ground]
25. A [groundhog would hog all the gro]und he could hog, if a groundhog could hog ground
